Hello, Everyone!

My name is Samuel Santos, a seasoned Full Stack Developer specializing in the Microsoft stack with more than 25 years in software development and team management in Banking, Startup and Fintech companies.

I graduated in Mechanical Engineering from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, one of the most prestigious universities in Brazil, and worked in their Robotics Lab until graduation. I post-graduated in Computer Science & System Project Management from Pontifícia Universidade Católica, also a renowned university in Brazil.

I am a researcher by nature and I am very proud to say that one of my research projects was awarded and recognized by EMBRAER aerospace corporation with the Mechanical Science and Engineering Brazilian Association prize in 2004.

In my college years, I also attended the Capital Markets & Securities Analyst For Trading Floor Certification course where I learned Fundamentals for Capital Markets and the Dynamics of a Trading Floor Negotiation. It’s something outside our IT world that I really really enjoy.

My CEO usually says that I am a T-shaped person collaborating and nurturing multiple areas of connections. I can easily cross beyond borders building strong bridges, because I am a developer with a mechanical engineering, academic research and financial background.

I am a seasoned C# .NET developer since its original release in 2002. I worked as a Senior Software Engineer in a Pension Fund IT solution company that later was acquired by Itau Bank, the largest banking institution in Brazil. I built queries and procedures for our SQL Server databases and led our team to develop and maintain the pension fund employee records and related applications. We used C# for our business logic tasks implementing a MVC architecture using Entity Framework too. 

The former CEO and founder made me an offer to build an IT team to join his new business from scratch. It was a freight forwarder startup.

My team developed a lot of cool things there, like an E-Commerce application integrated with Amazon Store API and a tailor-made Back Office CRM. We also integrated our system with some freight partners and payment gateways. I applied the Microsoft stack here including Entity Framework.

With my financial background in stock market trading systems, the founder of this company decided to propose a new challenge for me, to lead the building of a system to manage his stock portfolio that could make smart trade decisions based on technical analysis, using Quant trading strategies.

So, for the last 10 years I have been working as a Full Stack Developer in a fully remote position in his Fintech company.

Besides in the backend side the business logic was written in C#, for the frontend I also created an extensive JavaScript framework consuming JQuery library to help build dynamic and responsive web interfaces.
I designed the relational database in SQLServer, including queries and procedures. I decided to put the quotes data in a NoSQL file storage.
Very important here. I designed and created all the infrastructure of this company in AWS cloud.
Last year, I started a personal project to use some Deep Learning techniques using the Machine Learn .NET Framework with the purpose of getting better results in our prediction models. I’ve also used TensorFlow models coding in Python in vs code and google collab.

Currently I am looking for a more robust place that aims to be at the top of technology trends, triggering the free flow of ideas. I am committed to long term relationships working more than a decade in each company that I worked before.

I am sure I can bring value and a humble collaboration to my future partners.

I’d like to mention that for my personal evolution, I recently got some proficiency certifications in the MERN stack, I mean Mongo database, Express, React and Node.js. I believe these certifications help me show that I can support projects using these technologies. I also have an Azure cloud account where I can publish my cool things using this stack and also some labs using .NET Core microservice. You might take a look at my portfolio page where I am publishing some showcases from these labs.
So I can deal with the old stuff, not old, the legacy well developed software and I am also comfortable developing with these modern pretty new technologies. Okay ? Having me in your team, I think it’s the best of two worlds.

So, Now it’s your turn.
Let’s talk about your challenges. We can solve it!

I look forward to helping out your project!

Thanks for watching!

See you soon.

Bye!
