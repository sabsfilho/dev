Hello Everyone!

My name is Samuel Santos and I am going to suggest some questions for future interviews.

First topic
Do you have legacy systems working ? How to migrate them to the new microservices trends in the cloud ? Do you have any budget concerns about this transition ?
I am currently facing this discussion with my partners as they are saying that our legacy systems are working pretty well in a low cost environment. So, they cannot see any reason to do this migration. For me, I understand but it’s a problem for my personal evolution. So I am available for you.

Second topic
I’d like to have your view about this architecture paradigm using Infrastructure as a service or platform as a service. What are your considerations about them in your project ?
I came from companies that used bare metal servers that lived better than ourselves in a cool datacenter where we managed everything.
Nowadays in the AWS cloud we still prefer using virtual servers. We can easily support them and have the flexibility to adapt them to our environment needs. I don’t need the painful process of opening AWS support tickets. My partners consider it costly and risky to go to a totally managed cloud solution. So, what are your trade off opinions ?

Third topic
What do you think about a dedicated staging server for our developer team to deploy new system versions before releasing to our customers in the production environment ?
Recently I have had hard times with my partners here that transformed our staging server to one more production profile opened to the customer. Because of our time here, I’ll not give details about it, but in our constellation, we have lots of production servers supporting our clients processing needs and my partners decided to take this risk because of our low budget constraints. Lucky I am after a month I could get out staging server back. So, how would you deal with your project budget constraints and security demands ?

I’m looking forward to your answers knowing that everything depends on the context and cashflow. So, sharing thoughts could help me see different ways to approach a concern.

So, that’s it!
Thanks for watching!
Bye!
