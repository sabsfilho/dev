<p>The SFR Previtec former CEO and founder, a little after selling his shares to Itau Bank, made me an offer to build an IT team to join his new business, which was a startup that would help solve some logistics problems to send parcels from the US to Brazil, using our tech background.</p>

<p>His proposal included the possibility to work remotely and at that time it was pretty new and it was very attractive to me.</p>

<p>I hired 1 senior and 3 junior developers and outsourced the front end to Chop-Chop.org (Poland) and some backend procedures to the Tatvasoft.com (India) team. I also helped our Marketing Director to contract a digital marketing agency to set our SEO campaigns and a web design firm to create our visual identity and design our website.</p>

<p>As a Lead Engineer, I developed with my team many software solutions as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>E-Commerce application integrated with Amazon Store API;</li>
	<li>Tailor-made Back Office CRM for our workers improve customer service relationships;</li>
	<li>Client-server application that calculated customs taxes and fees, Brazilian Internal Revenue Service standard forms, and a payment system that allowed our customers to print a tax payment slip with a barcode following the banking standard that let them collect their taxes to the IRS at home by internet.</li>
	<li>HelpDesk integrated with LivePerson customer service solution.</li>
	<li>Web Services which Integrated our system with some partners like the Brazilian Post Office Correios, DHL, Amazon Merchant, PayPal, PagSeguro, Cielo, SafetyPay,Authorize.NET, FirstData, FirstBank, Bradesco Bank. We used RESTful API for some of these integrations and old fashioned raw data to Bradesco Bank process services and taxes payment.</li>
	<li>Supported our Marketing Director to implement an E-Commerce portal, changing our company profile from a freight-forward service company to a web store business. Inspired by our customers' product requests, I built a prototype that collected products presented in the Amazon web store using their legacy Amazon Marketplace Web Service (MWS) API and put them on our Brazilian website. He loved this concept and we created our shopping portal. Next we went further by hiring a translator company to translate the product description to Portuguese which helped our Brazilians customers understand and make good shopping choices.</li>
	<li>In 2012, inspired by the email design of Fab.com, an ecommerce site New York based company that used to sell third-party items from boutique design shops, I created a personal driven marketing campaign with a beautiful visual design presentation to our mailing list, mixturing some products that our customer profile usually checked in our portal. I developed an automated email and marketing platform integrated with Simple Email Service (AWS SES). We saw a great sales conversion, boosting our growth soar in a couple of days, but our operational staff was not prepared for this sudden increase in customers requests and struggled. Our CEO demanded us to stop this marketing channel immediately.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>All these solutions were coded in C# using Visual Studio tools and .NET Framework, using SQL Server database, .NET Entity Framework, DevExpress UI Controls and HTML5, jQuery, AJAX, RESTful API, AWS Cloud Services.</strong></p>

<p>We hosted our website and applications in bare metal Windows servers in the Softlayer data centers (now IBM cloud).</p>

<p>In order to process Credit Card payments transactions and store its data, we implemented <strong>the PCI compliance</strong> data security requirements on our solution. We also configured Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing tools to follow these compliance constraints.</p>

<p>After 2 years, the company was settled with almost 30 employees, having almost 20.000 registered customers, sending to Brazil around 100 packages per day, but we had problems with customs bureaucracy, unexpected cargo delays, package loss and theft. The owner decided to close this company but proposed another challenge to me, collaborate with him in PutCallBot a fintech project described above and where I have been currently working.</p>
