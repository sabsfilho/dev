<p>Itau Previtec was created in 2009 by a joint venture between SFR Previtec and Itau Bank, the largest banking institution in Brazil. It was later bought by Sinqia Company in 2020.</p>
<p>SFR Previtec was the greatest market share pension fund administration IT solution company in Brazil and had more than 25 years of history with almost 100 employees, distributed across Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Recife cities. Our outsourcing and software solution was adopted by the pension fund of GM, Volkswagen Ford, Nestle, AMBEV, Coca-Cola,  WEG, and more than 100 relevant companies.</p>
<p>I started there as an intern and worked as a software developer in the financial instruments management system department. After 2 years, I was hired as a software engineer.</p>
<p>Our tech team supported the business team to handle the pension fund portfolio, like Stocks, Derivatives, Private and Public Bond Securities.</p>
<p><strong>In the early days, we did the transition from COBOL database to Access database using Visual Basic.</strong></p>
<p>It was a Windows Application suite having UI Forms and an embedded database.</p>
<p>Later on, we started to develop a<strong> client-server model using ASP and HTML</strong>.</p>
<p>When Microsoft launched the <strong>.NET Framework using C# language</strong>, I joined the project to do another important transition to <strong>SQL Server database</strong>. I built <strong>procedures written in Transact SQL (T-SQL)</strong>, script batches for Windows servers and bashes for Linux terminals.</p>
<p>As we had our own datacenter, we started to provide a new client-server solution developing a web portal platform providing all legacy applications in a new friendly way for our clients.</p>
<p>This portal provided a scale and robust solution that allowed our company to expand the business plan and get more larger clients. <strong>I developed a javascript framework that helped our team develop and maintain dynamic content allowing our company to offer a rich user interface for our clients. Later, I redesigned this framework to use JQUERY in spite of directly using DOM.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I designed and developed the first mobile product provided by our company using Wireless Application Protocol WAP. This small application had a very intuitive user navigation menu allowing the fund pension managers to watch the real time market value position of his managed assets and easily get much more strategic  business information about his pension fund. I built a prototype and then we evaluated it to be a profitable product.</strong></p>
<p>After 6 years, I was promoted as a Project Manager. I led our team to develop and maintain the pension fund employee records and related applications. My team was composed of one senior, 3 junior developers and myself as a lead engineer, also coding and helping my colleagues in addition to providing communication support to stakeholders, business partners and our customers' teams.</p>
<p>We also developed a data management system using Business Intelligence (BI) concepts to be used by the board of pension fund directors to make fast decisions.</p>
<p>It was supported by a data warehouse using <strong>Microsoft OLAP</strong> solutions.</p>
<p>In the last year working there I attended some&nbsp; due diligence audits that&nbsp; helped Itau Bank members understand our operations and have a better knowledge of&nbsp; our team and infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>My last development project was a pension fund simulation that was a web application with a mobile UI using HTML5, CSS, JSON, JavaScript, JQuery, MS SQL Server, C# and .NET Framework.</strong> This application would be used by our clients&#39; employees to make some simulations using contributions, interest rate, retirement date, etc., allowing the employee to get a better idea which is better among Defined-Benefit vs. Defined Contribution Plans.</p>
