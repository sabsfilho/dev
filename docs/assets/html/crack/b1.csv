Some of my strengths are that I am friendly, an active listener, adaptable and have a self-taught mindset.
I try to inspire kindness and the friendliness of the people around me.
I also work using a Deep Work mindset with no distraction and very focused on the subject until the solution is done.

My most recurring weakness is a difficulty to speak to large audiences and a sort of difficulty to be more concise in explaining complex procedures in english. By the way, I am having one on one business english classes to overcome this weakness.
