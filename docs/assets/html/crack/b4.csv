I've been working for more than 25 years in software development in Brazilian Banking, Startup and Fintech companies.

For the last 10 years I have been working remotely in a Fintech as a Full Stack Developer specializing in C# .NET.

This Fintech provides stock market trading solutions, including an automated trading system, using Quant strategies.

I designed, developed and implemented all the system architecture and the business logic.

I also designed all the infrastructure in AWS cloud.

Last year I started a project to use some Deep Learning techniques with the purpose of getting better results in our prediction models.

In my previous job more than 10 years ago I was responsible for an e-commerce platform and before that I worked as a lead engineer managing 5 developers in a Pension Fund institution.

Actually I do a lot of research at work. I like the process of searching to find an answer. I think research is a great field where I can use my problem-solving skills. 
So, I'd like to say I am talented in research and also for sure I have a self-taught mindset and I really enjoy working as part of a team.

So that’s it! Let’s team up. Let’s get it started. What do you prepare for us today ?
