a TCP/IP network uses a three-way handshake to establish a client-server connection, where:

The client sends an SYN request to check whether the server has open ports.

The server with open ports responds by transmitting an SYN-ACK packet (acknowledgment packet).

The client acknowledges the response by returning an ACK packet to the server.
