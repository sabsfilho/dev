I've been working for more than 25 years in software development in Brazilian Banking, Startup and Fintech companies.

I graduated in Mechanical Engineering and post-graduated in Computer Science & System Project Management.

For the last 10 years I have been working remotely in a Fintech as a Full Stack Developer specializing in C# .NET,

This Fintech provides stock market trading solutions, including an automated trading system, using Quant strategies. Impacting real demanding users who are wealthy and high-profile banking customers.

I designed, developed and implemented all the system architecture and the business logic.

I also designed all the infrastructure in AWS cloud, including servers specifications and configurations.

Last year I started a project to use some Deep Learning techniques with the purpose of getting better results in our prediction models.

In my previous job more than 10 years ago I was responsible for an e-commerce platform and before that I worked as a lead engineer managing 5 developers in a Fund Pension and Banking institution.

Actually I do a lot of research at work. I like the process of searching to find an answer. I think research is a great field where I can use my problem-solving skills. The skill to find an answer for a stakeholder request, an issue in the environment, how to work when things stop working without any known reason. So, I am talented in research and also for sure I have a self-taught mindset.

This is my short story but I’d like to tell you something about this Andela opportunity before we get started.

I am truly happy with my career but I feel right now that I need a bigger challenge for myself. I’d like to work with people around the world and then improve my communication skills, especially in english. I think that would be great for me to join a foreign team, enjoying more culture and diversity in my life

So that’s it, I need your help on this target... Let’s team up. Let’s get it started.
