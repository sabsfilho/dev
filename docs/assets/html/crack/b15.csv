As I have a long journey walking on this path, now I am more serene and giving more importance to having good relations with people around me. 

I am truly happy with my career in a way that I am comfortable with my job position and I can share and give support to my colleagues. 

I am looking for a place where I can continue to research and apply new concepts and share ideas.
