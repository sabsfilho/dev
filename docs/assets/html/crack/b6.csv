the last time I was in a crunch was last week when my stakeholder demanded to change the profile of our staging server to production 
and even more he requested to activate the real trading signals to the broker.

I had published a new feature to this server to be evaluated before deploying to production, but unfortunately, this feature started to throw an exception in a situation that didn't happen in our development phase.

Because this server became a server with a production profile, I had to wait until the stock market operational period ended. 
Luckily this error crashed a tiny portion of the system functionality.

To avoid this kind of situation happening again we need to stick to the standard of the project which states we must not get rid of our staging environment.

We should instantiate another production machine.
