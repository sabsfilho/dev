I am a seasoned engineer with a strong financial and stock market background working for more than 25 years in this field.

I am a researcher who graduated in Mechanical Engineering and spent a good sum of time in the Robotic Lab participating in research projects.

Because one of these projects I was awarded and recognized by the Mechanical Science and Engineering Brazilian Association. I am really proud of it.

I am sure I can bring value from my long journey background and a humble collaboration to my future partners, sharing thoughts and having an active listening approach to my colleagues' opinions.

I try to inspire kindness and the friendliness of the people around me.

Another key point, my hour is a commodity that your budget can take advantage of. As I work from Brazil, we can together be very happy with the currency exchange rates. So, it's definitely a win–win game for us!

So I am sure you should hire me.
