In the BoxBrazil e-commerce project we suffered a brute force attack coming from inside the AWS network that the firewall couldn't filter.
 
I implemented a strict password policy via system-level enforcement in most of all my web services. so guaranteed no access to our database and information without strong authentication, strong password requirements and one direction encryption.

And those resources that are public and not sensible information , I block the offending IP request returning a bad request 400 code,

So this platform worked properly during the attack and until AWS support resolved the attack.
