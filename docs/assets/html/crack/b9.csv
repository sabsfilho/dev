I really do prefer the startup environment. I've been working for about 15 years for these types of companies.

I used to work to a Pension Fund and Banking institution and the hierarchy is so rigid that a simple number format in a report interface consumed a lot effort in order to get it approved,

I like the freedom of the ideas flow, We are closer to the founder that loves their business and are in general more open to assimilate new concepts and apply them faster.
