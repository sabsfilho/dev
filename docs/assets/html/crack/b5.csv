What were your main responsibilities in your previous job?
I designed, developed and implemented all the system architecture and the business logic.

I also designed all the infrastructure in AWS cloud, including servers specifications and configurations.

I am responsible for keeping all the ecosystem working.

I have daily meetings with my stakeholders to update my development progress about new features or system issues.

Eventually I attended meetings with broker compliance board members and their IT guys.

And rarely I talk to AWS engineers and sales account managers.

As I like to write, I do all the reports and financial memos to our clients.
