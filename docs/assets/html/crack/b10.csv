I had a tough situation when we lost a lot of clients in the pandemic market crash period. The founder of my Fintech company was thinking of suspending our operation.

I proposed to reduce our costs and suspend our math advisors consultancy services. I also suggested cutting and freezing some of our benefits.

We reduced our workforce at a minimum as we really believe that life would come back to normal.

We have been working non stop since then.
