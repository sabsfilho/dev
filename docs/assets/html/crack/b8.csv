For the last 10 years I have been working asynchronously in a full remote position.

I work using a Deep Work mindset with no distraction and very focused on the subject until the solution is done.

I really enjoy working as part of a team and I try to document in a simple way decisions or steps that I've taken and then let my partners read them.

In this way we can build great products and concepts decoupled without a tight dependency.
