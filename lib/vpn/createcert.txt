Create the OpenSSL Config

First set up a Virtual network Gateway in Azure.

Set up a Point-to-Site connection for OpenSSL. This is described here. It’s all straight forward, the tricky part is the creation of certs. You will end up with a Virtual Network on Azure and a VPN gateway if you follwo this tutorial. When creating the Point-to-Site connection choose tunnel tpye OpenVPN.

Create the certificates. This is described here as well. It all boils down to a few PowerShell commands.
Export the certificates (both root and client cert) as described here You will end up with a .cer file and a .pfx file.

generate the self-signed root certificate.
openssl genrsa -out caKey.pem 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key caKey.pem -subj "/CN=VPN CA" -days 3650 -out caCert.pem

Print the self-signed root certificate public data in base64 format.
openssl x509 -in caCert.pem -outform der | base64 -w0 && echo

generate a client certificate
export PASSWORD="Gate@5400"
export USERNAME="CODESPACE-01"

# Generate a private key
openssl genrsa -out "${USERNAME}Key.pem" 2048

# Generate a CSR (Certificate Sign Request)
openssl req -new -key "${USERNAME}Key.pem" -out "${USERNAME}Req.pem" -subj "/CN=${USERNAME}"

# Sign the CSR using the CA certificate and CA key
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in "${USERNAME}Req.pem" -CA caCert.pem -CAkey caKey.pem -CAcreateserial -out "${USERNAME}Cert.pem" -extfile <(echo -e "subjectAltName=DNS:${USERNAME}\nextendedKeyUsage=clientAuth")

	
    Hint: You will need the server cert to be able to set up the point to site connection. For this you can simply open your .cer file in a texteditor and copy the content into the “Public certifacte data” field in Azure Portal. Do not copy the “—-BEGIN CERTIFICATE …” and “—–END …” lines, just the content.
    If you are finished hit the “Download VPN client” button in Azure Portal on your Point-to-Site configuration. Azure Portal
